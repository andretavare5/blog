Going into the entry point, following the code, looking for interesting functions, I quickly spot the function at 0x406360. It’s calling LoadLibraryA but the lpLibFileName parameter is built dynamically at runtime using the stack. Its seems that we found a string encryption technique. Both the string and the xor key are loaded into the stack. Looking a bit more through the function, its seems that this is the way most of the strings are loaded: LEA EAX=\u003elocal_50,[ESP + 0x10] MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_50[0]],0x84038676 MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_50[4]],0xeb71eb3c MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_50[8]],0x36fb7b30 MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_50[12]],0xab7d1f0c MOVAPS XMM1,xmmword ptr [ESP + local_50[0]] MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_30[0]],0xea71e31d MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_30[4]],0xd9428759 MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_30[8]],0x5a971f1e MOV dword ptr [ESP + local_30[12]],0xab7d1f0c PXOR XMM1,xmmword ptr [ESP + local_30[0]] ; kernel32.dll PUSH EAX ; LPCSTR lpLibFileName for LoadLibraryA MOVAPS xmmword ptr [ESP + local_50[0]],XMM1 CALL ESI=\u003eKERNEL32.DLL::LoadLibraryA After XOR the encrypted string with the key, we get kernel32.dll.
