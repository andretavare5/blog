Hello! My name is André. I’m from Portugal and currently a Cyber Threat Intelligence Researcher at BitSight, experienced on tracking crimeware malware, including network infrastructure and distribution campaigns, through malware analysis, reverse engineering, and threat intelligence.  

Outside of work, my interests are outdoor activities, casual gaming, playing guitar, sustainability and open-source software.
