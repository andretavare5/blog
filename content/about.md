Hello! My name is André. I’m from Portugal and currently a Cyber Threat Intelligence Researcher at BitSight, mainly focused on tracking malware, specifically its campaings, distribution methods and network infrastructure. 

Outside of work, my interests are outdoor activities, casual gaming, playing guitar, sustainability and open-source software.
